Venetus B Quire Numbers

In the 11th century, the best way to create a manuscript like the Venetus B was to bind it in quires, or paper quantity measurements, of eight. This means

Whenever we discover something interesting or out of the ordinary within the Υ.1.1, we habitually turn to the manuscript's "twin", the Venetus B, to see if it also contains the same interesting aspects. So, naturally, when we found these quire numbers marking the gatherings within the Υ.1.1, we immediately decided to search the Venetus B for any similar quire numbers. We soon found that the Venetus B also contains quire numbers signifying both the beginning of a quaternion and the end of a quaternion. The first significant difference, however, is that the Venetus B does not contain any quire numbers until 9r (as opposed to 8r in the Υ.1.1), which had a small beta marking the beginning of the second quaternion. From this point on, the numbering appeared every eight folios on the recto side of the eighth folio. The first five quire numbers are surrounded by asterisks and other markings, making them very apparent on the bottom of the folio. However, later on, the remaining folios are marked simply with the number alone. It was not until 112v when we found a quire number (ΙΔ) marking the end of a quaternion. After this folio, we found most quaternions to have both a quire number marking its beginning on the recto side of the folio and its end on the verso side of the folio which precedes the next quaternion. There are, of course, some issues with the quire numbers which fortunately do not change the order of the quire arrangements at any time. Many numbers are very faint or cut off at the bottom of the folios. Others, are either mislabeled or corrected from a previous mistake in the numbering. There are a few missing from the folios as well because some folios were completely cut off at the bottom. Nevertheless, the order of the numbers stays in tact, which allowed us to count forty-two quire numbers in the Venetus B manuscript (the same amount as the Υ.1.1). Just like Υ.1.1, the Venetus B has not been examined in great depth. Therefore, until now, the quire numbers for both the Υ.1.1 and the Venetus B had never been discovered. We have made a list below, showing on what folios the quaternions begin and the line numbers of which they consist.

Quire Numbers ending a quaternion (on the verso sides of the last folios in the quaternions) are missing up to 112v.
